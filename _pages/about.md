My research passion lies at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, and cutting-edge instrumentation, driven by the fundamental quest to understand the origins of the most energetic particles in the universe.  I focus specifically on the experimental detection of ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrinos, whose energies exceed 100 PeV.  These elusive messengers travel cosmological distances unimpeded, carrying direct information about extreme astrophysical accelerators - sources like active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, or perhaps more exotic phenomena - that remain largely mysterious.  Detecting them requires innovative techniques and instrumentation operating at immense scales.
