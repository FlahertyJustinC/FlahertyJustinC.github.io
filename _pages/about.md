I am an astroparticle physicist studying ultra-high energy neutrinos as part of the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) and Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) collaborations.

During my graduate career, my research focused on the Askaryan Radio Array, a neutrino detector at the South Pole, and its capabilities of reconstructing the trajectory of a detected neutrino in order to identify its source in the sky.  When neutrinos interact in the South Pole ice they leave behind a radio signature called Askaryan Radiation.  The polarization of this radiation, which is the direction of its electric field, can be used to solve the neutrino trajectory.  We generated radio signals in the ice using calibration antennas, and those signals were detected by the Askaryan Radio Array.  We observed these signals from multiple detector stations simultaneously and found that the polarization observed by each station was different.  Our hypothesis is that this effect is due to the ice being birefringent, which means it has a polarization-dependent index of refraction.  This works out to two possible effects in our signal:  a rotation of the polarization, or a time-delay between polarization components.  We believe we can characterize this birefringence by understanding the Crystal Orientation Fabric (COF) of the ice, which is the arrangement of the ice crystals in the glacier.  There are two characteristic directions in the ice that we can use to help understand this:  the direction of ice compression in the vertical, and the direction that the glacier is moving (called ice flow).  These two directions affect the spacing of the ice crystals, and we predict that change in spacing to be the cause of the birefringent effects we see in the polarization.  My group at Ohio State will be using the results of my thesis to try mapping out this COF.
