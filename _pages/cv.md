Education
======
* Ph.D in Astroparticle Physics, The Ohio State University, 2024
* M.S. in Astroparticle Physics, The Ohio State University, 2020
* M.S. in Physics - Optics and Materials, Cleveland State University, 2018
* B.S. in Physics and Mathematics, Cleveland State University, 2016

Field Experience
======
* **Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station**, Antarctica
  * Deployed: January 5 - February 4, 2023
  * Performed excavation, maintenance, and calibration on various stations of the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA). Maintenance was performed both on the ice and in the IceCube Neutrino Observatory Lab. Calibration involved setting a radio transmitter at various positions relative to ARA stations on the ice.

* **Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP)**, Oklahoma, USA
  * Deployed: August 6 - August 20, 2017
  * Conducted atmospheric research with the Land-Atmosphere Feedback Experiment (LAFE) using Lidar. Primary duty was monitoring the line-of-sight of the laser for passing airplanes and other vehicles, momentarily disabling the laser so that they may pass safely.

Honors and Awards
======
* Antarctica Service Medal, United States Dept. of Defense, Spring 2023
* Riley Teaching Award, Ohio State Dept. of Physics, Spring 2020
* Hazel Brown Teaching Award, Ohio State Dept. of Physics, Spring 2019
* Sigma Pi Sigma Honorary Inductee, Cleveland State Dept. of Physics, Spring 2018
* Outstanding Physics Senior, Cleveland State Dept. of Physics, Spring 2016


Skills
======
* Extensive experience of signal processing in radio neutrino experiments and polarization reconstruction of Askaryan Signals.
* Knowledge of Monte Carlo and advanced data analysys techniques.
* Experience with Python/C++/ROOT.
